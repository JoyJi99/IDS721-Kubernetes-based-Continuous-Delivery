# Kubernetes based Continuous Delivery

This repo is the source code for IDS721-Project2-Kubernetes based Continuous Delivery.

## Target
- Create a customized Docker container from the current version of Python that deploys a simple python script.
- Push image to DockerHub, or Cloud based Container Registery (ECR)
- Project should deploy automatically to Kubernetes cluster
- Deployment should be to some form of Kubernetes service (can be hosted like Google Cloud Run or Amazon EKS, etc)

## Finished
- A simple flask web app has been completed.
- Dockerize application using Docker and push image to DockerHub
- Pull it onto AWS Cloud 9

## TODO
- Extend and push to Amazon ECR
- Pull onto new AWS Cloud 9 environment via ECR
- Pull into Amazon EKS

## How To Run
1. Install `virtualenv`:
```
$ pip3 install virtualenv
```

2. Open a terminal in the project root directory and run:
```
$ virtualenv env
```

3. Then run the command (for Mac):
```
$ source env/bin/activate
```

4. Then install the dependencies:
```
$ (env) pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```

5. Finally start the web server:
```
$ (env) python3 app.py
```

This server will start on port 5000 by default. You can change this in `app.py` by changing the following line to this:

```python
if __name__ == "__main__":
    app.run(debug=True, port=<desired port>)
```
